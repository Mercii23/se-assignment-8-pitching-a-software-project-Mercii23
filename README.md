 Questions:

1. Understanding the Audience:
   - Why is it important to understand your audience when pitching a software project? How can you tailor your pitch to different types of stakeholders (e.g., investors, technical team, customers)?

Understanding your audience when pitching a software project is crucial because different stakeholders have varying interests, concerns, and priorities. Tailoring your pitch to each audience helps in effectively communicating the value proposition of your project and gaining their support. Here’s why audience understanding is important and how you can tailor your pitch for different types of stakeholders:

Importance of Understanding Your Audience:
Relevance: Each stakeholder group (investors, technical team, customers) has specific needs and expectations. Addressing these directly increases the relevance of your pitch.

Perspective: Stakeholders view projects through different lenses (financial, technical feasibility, usability). Tailoring your pitch helps in aligning your project's benefits with their perspective.

Decision-Making: Understanding what influences their decision-making process allows you to emphasize aspects of your project that matter most to them, increasing the likelihood of gaining their support.

Tailoring Your Pitch to Different Stakeholders:
1. Investors:
